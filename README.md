##🕉️ Game of Yugas

"Game of Yugas" is an interactive web application inspired by the Hindu cosmological concept of the four ages: Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. This project aims to provide an engaging, educational experience, potentially through a quiz or narrative game, that explores the virtues and characteristics of each Yuga.

The game is built with a modern frontend stack, leveraging React and Vite for a fast, responsive, and scalable user experience.

##🚀 About The Project

This project serves as both a learning tool and an entertaining game. It is designed to guide users through the cyclical nature of time in Hindu cosmology, where each Yuga represents a progressive decline in moral and physical states, culminating in the dissolution and recreation of the world.

##Key Features:

    Interactive Gameplay: Engages users with questions or choices related to the Yugas.

    Educational Content: Provides insights into the philosophy and characteristics of each age.

    Dynamic UI: A clean and responsive interface built with React.

    Fast Development: Utilizes Vite for a rapid development server and optimized builds.

##🛠️ Built With

This project is built using modern web technologies:

    React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

    Vite: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides a faster and leaner development experience.

    HTML5 & CSS3: For structure and styling.
