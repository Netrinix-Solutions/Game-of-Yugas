"Game of Yugas" is an interactive web application inspired by the Hindu cosmological concept of the four ages: Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. This project aims to provide an engaging, educational experience, potentially through a quiz or narrative game, that explores the virtues and characteristics of each Yuga.

The game is built with a modern frontend stack, leveraging **React** and **Vite** for a fast, responsive, and scalable user experience.

## üöÄ About The Project

This project serves as both a learning tool and an entertaining game. It is designed to guide users through the cyclical nature of time in Hindu cosmology, where each Yuga represents a progressive decline in moral and physical states, culminating in the dissolution and recreation of the world.

### Key Features:
* **Interactive Gameplay**: Engages users with questions or choices related to the Yugas.
* **Educational Content**: Provides insights into the philosophy and characteristics of each age.
* **Dynamic UI**: A clean and responsive interface built with React.
* **Fast Development**: Utilizes Vite for a rapid development server and optimized builds.
